How to build a real robot?
This repo intended as lecture for a kindergaden students.

 What is a robot?
 is it it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw60Ma4c2bw
 Nope it looks much like a robot but it is not. It is AMP or Exosceleton. It requires a human to operate.
 So a robot is a machine. Machine is something that could work without human supervision.

 machines that could operate without humans.

 What is real robot? BumbleBee. We are not there yet.
 Could robot be without legs? Wally. Not there yer either. But
 Should it have hands? Not necessary. Roomba.
 
 What all of them have in common? They act without human intervention and the more independent and adequate theyir behaviour in different environment and situations the more real they are. Let's range them.
 Transformers and Wally 100% They are smart and adaptable to any situations.
 Atlas and Spot 75% They can handle real world but still pretty stupid.
 Roomba 50% It can sense a wall or furniture but the way it handles goggy poop or stairs shows how narrow theyr limits. 
 Assembly line and Zoltar 10% because they are not more than a clockwork machines.
  
 Sorry guys can't bring you an Atlas or even Spot to play with so we will start from the Roomba level. 
 
 What main parts robot consists of?
 Power source.
 Control circuit.
 Actuator.
 Even prayer wheel has power source and actuator. And water mill has even a rudimentary control cirquit.
 Since power sources and actuators are well studied for ages we'll concentrate on control cirquits.
 
 Roomba has pretty elaborate control cirquit. It collects data from sensors to avoid obstacles (bumper sensors) to navigate home (IR beacon sensor) to check batterey level and power consumption (power sensors) new models even build a floor plan in their memory. But roomba sill behaves pretty lame because it is legally blind.
